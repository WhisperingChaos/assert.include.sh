### API

#### assert_true \<bashTestEncapsulted\> ["${@}"]
Generate message indicating failure of stated condition when **\<bashTestEncapsulated\>** evaluates to *false*.  Otherwise, be silent.

  * **\<bashTestEncapsulated\>** any Bash [conditional expression](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Conditional-Expressions.html) [cocooned](https://github.com/WhisperingChaos/assert.source.sh/blob/master/README.md#cocoon) to satisfy its parser so it treats the expression as a single argument.  This delays the expression's evaluation so it can occur within the implementation of **assert_true**.
```
    pasContext="unexpected context"
    assert_true '[ "$pasContext" == "expected context" ]' 
```
   * Â **["${@}"]** forwards current argument values, $1-$N, of the function calling **assert_true**.  The position and values of these forwarded arguments are preserved within **assert_true** enabling the writting of **\<bashTestEncapsulated\>** expressions involving these arguments to reflect the presepective of the calling function.
  ```
    adminNm(){
        assert_true '[ "$1" == '\''admin'\'' ]' "${@}"
    }
    adminNm 'admin'
  ```
#### assert_false \<bashTestEncapsulted\> ["${@}"]
Negated form of [assert_true](https://github.com/WhisperingChaos/assert.source.sh/blob/master/README.md#assert_true-bashtestencapsulted-).

#### assert_output_true [\<commandExpected\> [\<argList\>]] \<inputDelim\> \<commandGenerate\> [\<argList\>]]
Compares the output, produced by **\<commandGenerate\>** to the output supplied by **\<commandExpected\>**.  The first comparison failue between these outputs produces an error message.  Otherwise, be silent (all outputs match).  Comparison failures include situations where one command produces more output than the other one.

This alternate form, differs from [piping](http://www.linfo.org/pipes.html) *(|)*, as it captures both STDOUT and STDERR of **\<commandGenerate\>** function and executes **assert_output_true** within the current process.  Also it's generally simpler to encode than piping and ensures proper assertion behavior.  A more indepth explaination follows.
  * **[\<commandExpected\>]** An optional addressible Bash function or CLI command whose STDOUT and STDERR will be consumed as input by **assert_output_true**.  If omitted or fails to generate output, **\<commandGenerate\>** must also omitt output from STDOUT or STDERR to affirm the assertion. In situations when **\<commandExpected>** produces output, each output line can be selectively prefixed by *${assert_REGEX_COMPARE}* *('\<RegEx\>')* to dynamically switch between an exact or regex pattern match.  See below for details.   
  * **[\<argList\>]** An optional list of arguments passed to  **\<commandExpected\>**
  * **\<inputDelim\> \<commandGenerate\> [\<argList\>]]** 
    * **\<inputDelim\>** A pattern separating the invocation and associated parameters of **\<commandExpected\>** from **\<commandGenerate\>**.  It's defined by *${assert_INPUT_CMD_DELIMITER}* *('---')*.
    * **\<commandGenerate\>** An addressible bash function or CLI command whose STDOUT and STDERROR will be consumed unaltered by **assert_output_true** and compared to **\<commandExpected\>**.
    * **[\<argList\>]** An optional argument list passed into **\<commandExpected\>**.
    
The comparision function uses the Bash *read* command to consume the output produced by both commands. Each *read* command transfers its data into an environment variable.  The content of the two environment variables are then compared to identify differences between the outputs produced by **\<commandGenerate\>** and **\<commandExpected\>**.  When first devised, a smallish collection of human readable newline terminated text was expected as the output supplied by **\<commandGenerate\>** and **\<commandExpected\>**.  However, *read* also consumes any data streamed via STDIN, including the contents of executable files.  Therefore, one can compare the contents of non-human readable sources as long as there's enough memory to maintain two, potentially complete, in memory replicas.  Furthermore, the comparison function offers both regular expresssion and simple equality matching.

Equality matching performs an exact binary comparision between a newline delimited block of bytes read from **\<commandGenerate\>** correlated to a corresponding newline delimited block of bytes read from **\<commandExpected\>**.  Although this uncompromising form of comparision offers a generally useful operator, it can be dynamically replaced by a regular expression comparator providing flexible pattern matching.  To dynamically specify a regular expression comparator, prefix select newline delimited byte blocks with *${assert_REGEX_COMPARE}* during their construction by **\<commandExpected\>**.  As the comparator function process each delimited byte block, it tests for the presense of the regex prefix.  Its detection triggers the comparision function to apply Bash's regular expression operator *(=~)*, instead of Bash's exact string match one *(==)*.
```
commandGenerated(){
cat <<GEN
line_1
line_2
line_3 $(date +%m/%d/%y)
line_4
GEN
}
commandExpected(){
# first, second & forth line use ==
# third line applies regex comparison
cat <<EXPECTED
line_1
line_2
${assert_REGEX_COMPARE}line_3 .*
line_4
EXPECTED
}
assert_output_true commandExpected --- commandGenerated
```

The usual coding idiom to capture the output of **\<commandGenerate\>**  involves [piping](http://www.linfo.org/pipes.html) ex: ```test_5_generate | assert_output_true test_5_expected``` to feed STDIN of **assert_output_true** with the STDOUT of  **\<commandGenerate\>**.  Although this piped form will produce an appropriate message and return code *($?)*, other assert features, such as **assert_halt** and **assert_return_code_set**, rely on a source level variable to remember the outcome of an assert's execution.  Since piping starts an independent child process, updates to the source level variable performed by the child process are limited to the child process' copy of the parent process' source level variable.  Therefore, when the child process terminates, the parent process source level variable reflects the value last assigned to this variable immediately before starting the child process (by piping) discarding any changes applied by the child process while it ran.  There are at least two methods to circumvent this signal loss.

The easiest method to preserve changes to the source level variable employs the form of **assert_output_true** requiring one to specify the parameters **\<inputDelim\> \<commandGenerate\> [\<argList\>]**.  This form executes **assert_output_true** within the current process spawning a subprocess to execute **\<commandGenerate\> [\<argList\>]** capturing its STDOUT for comparison.  By executing **assert_output_true** within the same process, changes to the source level variable are properly preserved ensuring the expected behavior of other assert features dependent on its value. 
```
test_5_generated(){
    echo "line-$1"
    echo "line_$2"
}
test_5_expected(){
    test_5_generated "${@}"
}
assert_output_true test_5_expected '1' '2' --- test_5_generated '1' '2'
```
Besides the method demonstrated above, a second one, more akin to the traditional piping mechanism, can be encoded.

The second method combines **assert_true** with **assert_output_true** by specifying **assert_output_true** as a **\<bashTestEncapsulted\>** expression.  In this situation, **assert_true** executes within the current process, allowing it to affect source variable vaues while **assert_output_true** is spawned as the last child process in a pipe.  This ordering of **assert_output_true** feeds the STDOUT of an upstream command to its STDIN.  Since **assert_output_true** will generate both an appropriate output and return code value, **assert_true** can then apply ("forward") the source level variable update that would have happened had **assert_output_true** been performed within the context of the parent process.
```
test_5_generated(){
    echo "line-$1"
    echo "line_$2"
}
test_5_expected(){
    test_5_generated "${@}"
}
assert_true "test_5_generated '1' '2' | assert_output_true test_5_expected '1' '2'"
```
The downsides of this approach include: 
  * The difficulty in properly [cocooning](https://github.com/WhisperingChaos/assert.source.sh/blob/master/README.md#cocoon) a potentially complex expression.
  * The additional assertion failure message produced by **assert_true** which appears immediately after the one generated by **assert_output_true**.

#### assert_output_false [\<commandExpected\>] [\<argList\>] [\<inputDelim\> \<commandGenerate\> [\<argList\>]]
Negated form of **assert_output_true**.  Requires every delimited block of bytes generated by **\<commandGenerate\>** be different from its corresponding block produced by **\<commandExpected\>**. Otherwise, if at least one corresponding block matches, this assertion is triggered.  In constrast to **assert_output_true**, a mismatch in the number of either **\<commandGenerate\>** or **\<commandExpected\>** will affirm the assertion, as long as the provided compared outputs preserve the assertion.  

#### assert_halt
After invoking this function, the next failure detected by an assertion will cause the current process to abruptly terminate with an error code of '1'.

#### assert_continue
After invoking this function, the current process will continue execution through failures detected by subsequent assertions.  When assertion failures occur in this mode, the fact that a failure occurred is remembered.  This is the default behavior of this assertion library.  Once testing completes, the **assert_return_code_set** can be called to establish the return code value for the entire test.  

#### assert_bool_performant
Implements the evaluation of **assert_true** within the current process - doesn't spawn a child process. Therefore, an incorrectly formed **\<bashTestEncapsulted\>** will terminate the current process.  Also, an evaluation violating the constraint enforced by an assert is performed a second time in order to generate a useful message.  The code attempts to limit this second evaluation to only environment variables, as evaluating other expressions, like those used to start a subprocess, may result in undesirable side effects when executed a second time.  In general, limiting evaluation to only environment variables is usually sufficient to debug the assert failure.  However, in certain situations, a more detailed evaluation of the expression can be produced using **assert_bool_detailed**

The assert library uses this performant form as its default implementation.
```
# by default, don't have to call assert_bool_performant
assert_bool_performant
assert_false '[ "$1" == "b"]'
assert_true '[ "$1" == "a" ]'
.
.
```
#### assert_bool_detailed
Implements the evaluation of **assert_true** within a subprocess of the current one.  It uses *set -x* and captures its output providing detailed evaluation of the entire **\<bashTestEncapsulted\>** expression.  Capturing is performed as the expression is evaluated, therefore, a second evaluation, to generate a message when the assert fails isn't required, as is the case when using **assert_bool_performant**.  Due to subprocess spawning, **assert_bool_detailed** is resilient to problematic expressions that would cause the performant implementation to abnormally terminate its current process.  However, it does fork a subshell which "costs" some amount of time and resources.

Typically, its more resource efficient and speedier to use the implementation of **assert_bool_performant**.  However, since either implementation can dynamically replace the other, it might be advisable to use **assert_bool_detailed** when first developing a test script, due to its reliability and detailed evaluation output, then once the test script becomes stable, simply replace it with **assert_bool_performant**.
```
# using detailed implementation of assert_true
assert_bool_detailed
assert_true '[ "$1" == "$( echo "b") ]'
.
.
# replace detailed implenentation of assert_true with performant version
assert_bool_performant
assert_false '[ "$1" == "b"]'
assert_true '[ "$1" == "a" ]'
.
.
```

#### assert_return_code_set
A function whose execution sets the return code for the process.  Encode it as the last command executed by the test script, especially when testing through assertions by specifying **assert_continue** mode (the package's default behavior).

### Terms
#### Cocoon
An expression encaspulation mechanism that prevents immediate evaluation.
Mechanisms include:
  * Bash single quoting.  When single quotes must themselves be encapsulated, Bash offers string concatenation.  
  ```
  $ echo 'encapsulated string: ">|#()<?[{}]:!'
  encapsulated string: ">|#()<?[{}]:!
  ```
  * Bash string concatenation.
  ```
  $ echo 'encapsulated string including single quote: ">|#()<?'"'"'[{}]:!'
  encapsulated string including single quote: ">|#()<?'[{}]:!
  ```
  * Bash single character concatenation.
  ```
  $ echo 'encapsulated string: ">|#()<?'\'\e\f\g'[{}]:!'
  encapsulated string: ">|#()<?'efg[{}]:!
  ```
  * Indirect expression evaluation via Bash function call.
```
#!/bin/bash
source ../component/assert.source.sh
express_encap(){
    [ "$1" == 'Beautiful' ] && ([ "$2" == "Morning" ] || [ "$2" == 'Evening' ]) 
}
sunrise(){
    assert_true 'express_encap "${@}"' "${@}"
}
sunrise 'Beautiful' 'Morning'
```
